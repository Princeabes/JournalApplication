    <h5>This API is a Spring Boot application that manages journal entries using MongoDB. It provides RESTful endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting journal entries. The `JournalEntryController` handles HTTP requests, mapping them to corresponding CRUD operations. Each journal entry includes a title, content, and timestamp, stored in MongoDB as documents. The application leverages dependency injection, with the service layer managing business logic and the repository layer handling database interactions. Designed for scalability, this API can be easily extended with features like user authentication and front-end integration.<h5>
